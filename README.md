打开培训网站，点击插件让其运行，视频位置会增加一个进度条
很多培训网站禁止的就是一些完全不懂代码的普通用户，所有显示加快进度的手段都是极度简陋的，
1.很多就是标签加一个禁止改变的选项
2.隐藏进度条
3.加一个覆盖层，阻止鼠标拖动
4.复杂一点的加一个事件监视器，一拖动就校验
5.加个定时器，校验进度条是否改变
软件原理就是增加一个进度条调整视频当前时间，特色是处理了vue框架的几个限制措施
请尽情享用吧
Open the training website, click on the plugin to run it, and a progress bar will be added to the video location. 
Many training websites prohibit some ordinary users who don't understand code at all. All means of accelerating progress are extremely simple. 
1. Many are just tags with an option to prohibit changes
2. Hide the progress bar
3. Add a cover layer to prevent mouse dragging
4. More complex ones add an event monitor to verify when dragging
5. Add a timer to verify if the progress bar changes The software principle is to add a progress bar to adjust the current time of the video.
6. The feature is that it deals with several restrictive measures of the Vue framework.
Please enjoy it.
